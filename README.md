# Adjacency_Matrix_With_Directed_Graph
A program that produces a randomly generated adjacency matrix along with a matching directed graph.
In this program, the ability to move from one node to another is represented by lines that are the color blue and red. If a node is touching the blue side of a line connecting it to another node, travel in the direction of the original node to the other node is permitted. However, if a node is touching the red side of the line connecting it to another node, movement from the original node to the other node is not permitted. An entirely blue line means that either node can freely move to the other node the blue line connects it to.
